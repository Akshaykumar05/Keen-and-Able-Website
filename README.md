## Dependencies

### 1. Tailwindcss

**Tailwind CSS differs from other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap in that it doesn't provide predefined classes for elements like buttons or tables. Instead, it provides a set of opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that can be used directly inside markup to design an element.**

```
npm install -D tailwindcss
npm tailwindcss init
```

***Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.***

<p>Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.</p>

```
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

***Add the Tailwind directives to your index.CSS***

<p>Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your ./src/index.css file.</p>

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 2. Axios

<p>Axios, which is a popular library is mainly used to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints. This library is very useful to perform CRUD operations.</p>

<ol>
  <li>This popular library is used to communicate with the backend. Axios supports the Promise API, native to JS ES6.</li>
